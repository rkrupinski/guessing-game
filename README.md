# Guessing game

Milestones (the order matters):

1. Ask in the console for guessing a random number between 1 and 10. The player only has one chance and the correct answer is always 8.
2. Tweak the program to draw a random winning number every game.
3. Give the player N attempts.
4. Change the range to 1-100 and if the player guesses incorrectly, give him a hint that the number is either too big or too small.
5. If the answer has already appeared before, let the player know that the move was dumb.
6. If you hint the player that the number given was to small and he responds with an even smaller one, let him know that the move was dumb.
7. M (M < N) dumb moves end the game with a different message.
8. If the player follows a hint, let him know.
9. Add a test suite.
10. Change the interface from the console to Web or... Siri/Alexa.
